### Size Matters Not

To install, copy the `out_modelblock.bin` and `out_splineblock.bin` files into the following path and replace the existing ones:

`Star Wars Episode I Racer / data / lev01 / `

**Ronto-Sized** - Tracks are 1.9x scale (tilting should help resolve issues with falling through collision)  
**Jawa-Sized** - Tracks are 0.4x scale  
**Squash & Stretch** - Tracks squashed on x axis, stretched on y axis  
**Hallways & Hairpins** - Tracks stretched on x axis, squashed on y axis  
**Rise Over Run** - Tracks are on a 0.33x slope  
**Low Clearance** - Tracks squished on z axis  
**Head Room** - Tracks exaggerated on z axis  
**Bumpy Ride** - Track vertices are randomly offset  
**Flatooine** - Tracks are completely flattened, fall collision tag is removed  
**Australia Be Like** - Tracks are inverted on z axis (mostly playable except a handful of soft locks and janky respawns)  

Enjoy,
