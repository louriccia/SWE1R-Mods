This is a set of texture packs of programatically modified textures. To install, copy one of the out_textureblock.bin files into the following path and replace the existing one:

Star Wars Episode I Racer / data / lev01 / out_textureblock.bin

DarkMode - all textures completely blacked out
GrayArea - all textures converted to grayscale
InvertedMode - all texture colors inverted
LightMode - all textures completely whitewashed
MagicEye - texture pixels are scrambled
PaintBallArena - colors are randomized

Enjoy,
