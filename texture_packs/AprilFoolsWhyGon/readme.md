This is a dumb april fool's joke texture pack that swaps most game textures with Qui-Gon Jinn's face texture. Originally titled "4k Retexture Upscale HD Enhanced High Resolution Reworked Official Patch"

To install, copy out_textureblock.bin into the following path and replace the existing one:

Star Wars Episode I Racer / data / lev01 / out_textureblock.bin

Enjoy,
