### Restored Textures v1.1

This mod restores a handful of scrambled textures to their intended state in the N64 version of the game. Most noteable improvements are the Oovo IV anti-gravity tubes and Ord Ibanna railings/roofing/scaffolding.

To install, copy the `out_textureblock.bin` file into the following path and replace the existing one:

`Star Wars Episode I Racer / data / lev01 / `

This texture pack would not exist without the sharp eye and skills of Hellfire (Dredge#8402) who first made an observation about the scrambled textures on pc.
