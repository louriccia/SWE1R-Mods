This is a set of texture packs of programatically modified textures. To install, copy one of the out_textureblock.bin files into the following path and replace the existing one:

Star Wars Episode I Racer / data / lev01 / out_textureblock.bin

Note: For most of these texture packs, it is recommended that you force a more pixelated look by going into your dgVoodoo control panel under the ‘DirectX’ tab and selecting ‘Force point sampled’ and check ‘Disable mipmapping’ under the Texturing section.

Pro-tip: You don’t need to completely restart your game to install these texture packs! In fact, you can keep a folder of texture packs inside your lev01 folder (as well as a backup folder), and swap out your current out_textureblock.bin on the fly while the game is running. You just need to restart/start a race to apply changes.
