# SWE1R Mods
 
This is a collection of mods I've made and am in the process of making for Star Wars Episode I: Racer. They all involve some type of mass manipulation of the game's archives `out_modelblock.bin`
`out_textureblock.bin`
`out_splineblock.bin`
`out_spriteblock.bin`

To install these mods, just swap out your files in `Star Wars Episode I Racer / data / lev01 /` with the files included in the mod. 
You donâ€™t need to completely restart your game to install these mods! You can keep a mod inside your lev01 folder (as well as a backup folder), and swap out mods on the fly while the game is running. You just need to restart/start a race to apply changes.

All my work is and will remain freely accessible but here's a link if you want to throw some truguts my way.
